                    Welcome to my github page. I currently work as the Director of Strategy & Client Services at Inntopia. We provide 
                    marketing software solutions, primarily for the resort and ski industries. I am also currently enrolled in a Data Analytics and Visualizations Bootcamp at the University of Minnesota.
                    I've built out this About Me page to hightlight some of the projects I've been working on.

                    <br>
                    When I'm not working, I really enjoy spending time with my family.  We love to explore, bike, and ski. I also really enjoy finding new ways
                    to push myself by particpating in endurance events. I have
                    also developed a found interest in programming and data visualizations, which lets me hone my skills while I bring new ideas to light.
                    <br>
