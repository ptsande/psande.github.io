                    Welcome to my github repo pages.  I'm currently enrolled in a Data Analytics and Visualizations Bootcamp at the University of Minnesota.<br>
                    These are the files I've been working on. I currently work as the Director of Strategy & Client Services at Inntopia.  <br>We provide 
                    marketing software solutions, primarily for the resort and ski industries.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When I'm not working, I really enjoy spending time with my family.  We love to explore, bike, and ski.<br>  I also really enjoy finding new ways
                    to push myself by particpating in endurance events. <br> I have
                    also developed a found interest in programming and data visualizations, which lets me hone my skills<br> while I bring new ideas to light.
                    <br>
